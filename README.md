# 🎧 Wordplay

Wordplay is a community-driven music platform built to spotlight emerging hip‑hop and rap artists through curated instrumentals, creative challenges, and fair exposure.

The goal of Wordplay is simple: **give artists a reason to create, compete, and be discovered — without pay‑to‑win mechanics or exploitative models.**

## 🚀 What is Wordplay?

Wordplay hosts recurring music challenges where artists:

* Download or are assigned a featured instrumental
* Create an original track within a set timeframe
* Submit their work to the platform
* Gain exposure through community discovery and curation

Winning or featured artists may receive:

* Exclusive or extended rights to the instrumental
* Promotion on Wordplay channels
* Placement on curated playlists
* Revenue participation (where applicable)

## 🎯 Core Principles

* **Artist‑first** – No paid voting or gambling mechanics
